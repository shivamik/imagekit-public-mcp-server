# Transformation Builder Skill

## IMPORTANT: Read This BEFORE Calling the Tool

This skill MUST be invoked and read before you call `transformation_builder`. It contains critical instructions for identifying the right capability, crafting precise queries, and ordering multi-step transformations that determine whether the tool produces correct results.

**Workflow:**
1. Agent reads this skill (you are here)
2. Agent identifies the correct capability using the Intent → Capability Mapping below
3. Agent crafts a precise query using the Query Crafting Guide
4. Agent calls `transformation_builder` with the prepared query
5. Agent handles results or failures following the rules below

## When to use (triggers this skill)
- User requests resize, crop, or focus on specific areas
- User wants filters, overlays, or visual effects
- User describes multi-step transformation chains
- User needs background removal (especially with upscaling)
- User wants AI-powered image editing of any kind

## Background Removal: Clarify Intent

When user says "remove background" without specifying the approach, **ask which option they prefer**:

1. **Real-time URL transformation** — Applies `e-bgremove` via transformation URL. Best for on-the-fly delivery, no new file stored.
2. **Remove and upload** — Applies background removal extension and uploads the result to DAM as new file version.

## Critical: Background Removal Sequence

**ALWAYS apply background removal AFTER upscale/retouch, NEVER before.**

Correct: `Upscale -> Then remove background`
Wrong: `Remove background -> Then upscale`

Use `e-bgremove` (not `ai_remove_background`) for background removal.

## Calling `transformation_builder`

After reading this skill and preparing your query, call the tool with:
- `query`: The precise, rewritten query (see Query Crafting Guide below — NEVER pass vague user input directly)
- `src`: Optional source URL (defaults to sample image)

**Chain transformations**: Frame multi-step requests as a single query.
- User: "1) Resize to 800x600 2) Crop to face"
- Query: "Resize to 800x600, then crop to focus on face"

## Query Routing & Crafting Guide

Users describe what they want in vague, everyday language. Your job is to **identify the right IK capability** and **rewrite the query** into a precise, tool-friendly description. Never pass vague queries through as-is.

### Intent → Capability Mapping

Use this table to decide which capability handles the user's request:

| User Intent (vague) | Maps To | Why |
|---|---|---|
| "Make the red balls green", "enlarge the cat", "remove the car", "add sunglasses" | `ai_edit` | Modifying **specific objects or regions** within the image requires AI content editing |
| "Put this on a beach", "change background to sunset", "make it look like they're in Paris" | `ai_changebg` | Replacing the **background scene** while keeping the subject |
| "Remove the background", "make it transparent", "cut out the person" | `ai_remove_background` | Removing the background entirely (transparent output) |
| "Make it wider without stretching", "extend the sky", "add more space on the left" | `ai_bg_genfill` | Expanding the image canvas with **AI-generated content** beyond original bounds |
| "Make it higher resolution", "it's blurry can you fix it", "enhance quality" | `ai_upscale` | Increasing resolution / fixing low-res images |
| "Clean up this photo", "remove blemishes", "fix skin imperfections" | `ai_retouch` | General visual quality improvement and artifact removal |
| "Add a realistic shadow", "make the product look like it's on a surface" | `ai_drop_shadow` | Adding natural-looking shadows (transparent images only) |
| "Create a variation", "give me a different version", "remix this image" | `ai_genvar` | Generating visual variations while preserving structure |
| "Generate an image of a sunset over mountains" | `ai_gen_image` | Creating a brand new image from text (no source image needed) |
| "Make it 800x600", "resize for Instagram", "make it smaller", "crop to 16:9" | `resize_and_crop` | Changing overall **dimensions, aspect ratio, or crop** of the image |
| "Focus on the face", "crop around the product", "zoom into the subject" | `resize_and_crop` (with `focus`) | Smart cropping using face/object detection |
| "Change all red pixels to blue", "swap the background color from white to gray" | `color_replace` (effects) | Global **pixel-level color swap** across the entire image |
| "Make it black and white", "blur it", "sharpen", "rotate 90°", "add a border" | `effects_and_enhancement` | Standard image filters and adjustments |
| "Add my logo on top", "put a watermark", "overlay this badge" | `image_overlay` | Compositing another image on top |
| "Write 'SALE 50% OFF' on the image", "add a caption" | `text_overlay` | Rendering text on the image |

### Key Distinction: `ai_edit` vs `color_replace` vs `ai_changebg`

These three are commonly confused. Use this decision tree:

1. **Is the user changing specific objects/regions?** (e.g. "make the balls bigger", "turn the car red") → **`ai_edit`**
2. **Is the user swapping a color globally across all pixels?** (e.g. "replace all #FF0000 with #00FF00") → **`color_replace`**
3. **Is the user replacing the entire background scene?** (e.g. "put them on a beach") → **`ai_changebg`**

### How to Craft Good Queries

**Rule: Always rewrite the user's vague request into a query that references actual IK parameters and capabilities. Use parameter names when you know them; fall back to descriptive English only when the exact parameter is unclear.**

| User Says | Bad Query (don't do this) | Good Query |
|---|---|---|
| "Make the red balls bigger and the blue ones green" | "make red balls bigger and blue balls green" | "Apply `ai_edit` with prompt: increase the size of the red-colored balls and change the blue-colored balls to green" |
| "Can you clean this up and put it on a white background?" | "clean up and white background" | "Apply `ai_retouch`, then `ai_remove_background`, then `ai_changebg` with prompt: solid white background" |
| "I want this to look like a painting" | "make it look like a painting" | "Apply `ai_edit` with prompt: transform into an oil painting style with visible brush strokes and artistic texture" |
| "Crop around the person's face" | "crop face" | "Apply `resize_and_crop` with `focus` set to `face` to crop around the detected face" |
| "Add some text saying Hello World at the bottom" | "add hello world text" | "Apply `text_overlay` with `text`='Hello World', `layer_y`=bottom, `layer_focus`=bottom" |
| "Make this fit for a mobile banner" | "mobile banner" | "Apply `resize_and_crop` with `width`=640, `aspect_ratio`=2-1" |
| "The background is boring, make it interesting" | "change background" | "Apply `ai_changebg` with prompt: vibrant gradient studio backdrop" |
| "Extend the image to make it panoramic" | "make panoramic" | "Apply `ai_bg_genfill` to extend image horizontally with `aspect_ratio`=3-1" |
| "This is too low quality" | "fix quality" | "Apply `ai_upscale`, then `ai_retouch`" |
| "Make it 300px wide and add a red border" | "resize and border" | "Apply `resize_and_crop` with `width`=300, then apply `border` with color red and width 5" |
| "Blur everything and put white text on top" | "blur and text" | "Apply `blur`=10, then `text_overlay` with `text`='Your Text', `color`=white, `font_size`=40, `layer_focus`=center" |
| "Remove background and add a drop shadow" | "remove bg shadow" | "Apply `ai_remove_background`, then `ai_drop_shadow`" |

### Multi-Step Query Chaining

When the user's request involves multiple capabilities, **chain them in one query in the correct order**:

1. **Upscale / Retouch first** (quality improvements)
2. **AI edits** (content changes) 
3. **Background removal / change** (always after content edits)
4. **Resize / Crop** (final dimensions)
5. **Effects / Overlays** (finishing touches)

Example: User says "clean up this photo, remove the background, and make it 500x500"
→ Query: "Apply `ai_retouch`, then `ai_remove_background`, then `resize_and_crop` with `width`=500, `height`=500"

## Handling Failures

1. **400 / Bad Request**: Invoke the `search-docs` skill first, then call `search_docs` for parameters/limits
2. **Multiple failures (3+)**: Invoke `search-docs` skill, then call `search_docs` to find supported methods and constraints
3. **Unsupported**: Search docs to confirm, offer alternatives if available

## Gotchas

- Background removal order matters: upscale/retouch first
- Use `e-bgremove`, not `ai_remove_background`
- Source URL must be ImageKit-hosted
- "Save this image" means upload to DAM via `file-upload-and-dam` skill
